- Storyline version 1.0 (Sep 20)

Since the beginning of time, the land of Erotoma was created by the grace of The Beings. The Beings created a land full of diversity. Creatures were created in the likeness of The Beings. As time passed, these creatures have evolved and had started naming themselves and creating factions based on which of The Beings had created them. Thus, Erotoma was split into 3. The Saroia, The Quacero, and The Azrue. Each having their own cultures but all share the same language.

As the factions grew, so did their ideals. The difference of their ideals were enough to cause a war amongst the 3 factions. What seemed to be a war that would last forever was abruptly ended due to the birth of The Entity. If it wasn't for the legends being passed down from generations, the existence of The Entity would be long forgotten. The Entity was a being of pure chaos. It had almost wiped out the 3 factions... until The Beings intervened. It was the first time and the last time that the factions ever saw The Beings. As right after The Beings fought The Entity, they all vanished to the far horizon where none of the Factions could see. After the disappearance of The Beings and The Entity, the 3 factions decided to make peace and unite to rebuild for a better civilization.

Fast forward to the current era. In the center of Erotoma lies the heart of the 3 factions. A city of diversity, Azsaroqua. A city where Saroians, Quaceron, and Azrueians gather to share their culture and traditions. 

In this city, 3 friends with different cultures share the same outlook in life, to search for the whereabouts of The Beings.

The 3 embark on a quest after hearing about a rumour of a sudden appearance of a small island in the far outskirts of Erotoma containing what seems to be a temple.
