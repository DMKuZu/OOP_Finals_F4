         CHAPTER 1: THE CHOICE AND THE SEPARATION 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In the mystical world of Erotoma, where balance between magic and life hangs by a thread, you stand at the Shrine of Beings, tasked with choosing one of several characters to lead a quest to save the world from looming destruction. Each character represents a powerful race tied to Erotoma's essence, but only one path can be chosen.

After your decision, chaos erupts. A freak accident occurs, splitting you from your companions and throwing you into a void. As you drift through this strange space, a Being—one of the last of its kind—appears before you, warning of a force known as **The Entity**, a malevolent power that threatens the entire world.

But before you can ask questions, the Being vanishes, and the world shatters. You wake up in a twisted version of Erotoma, alone, and with a gnawing sense of something not being right.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
          CHAPTER 2: THE CORRUPTION OF A FORMER ALLY
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

As you traverse the warped lands of Erotoma, which are now twisted by The Entity’s influence, you come across one of the characters you didn’t choose at the beginning of your journey. However, they are no longer the person you remember. Corrupted by The Entity, they now lead their once-noble race into darkness and ruin.

This former ally confronts you as the boss of this chapter. The fight is as much emotional as it is physical, filled with bitterness and accusations of betrayal. "You chose to abandon us!" they shout, their attacks infused with the dark power of The Entity. The battle becomes an inner conflict for you, as their words stir doubt within your heart.

After a fierce struggle, you manage to defeat them. But their final words echo ominously: “You are nothing but a pawn. You think you chose this path? You’re just following orders… like a puppet.” Their death leaves you with unsettling questions about your own purpose.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
               CHAPTER 3: ANOTHER BETRAYED
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Pushing deeper into the corrupted world, you face yet another former ally—another character you didn’t select at the start. Like the first, they have fallen under the control of The Entity and lead their race into chaos.

The confrontation is intense. This boss accuses you of being complicit in The Entity’s rise, claiming that your choices were always manipulated. "You think you're the hero? You’re part of the problem! The Entity has you under its control!" they shout as the battle rages on.

You eventually defeat this boss, but their last words send a chill down your spine: “You don’t even know who you really are.” Doubt begins to creep in, and you start questioning your own identity and purpose.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
              CHAPTER 4: THE FINAL BATTLE
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You finally reach the core of the corrupted world, where The Entity awaits. But before you can face it, another figure emerges from the shadows—**your clone**. Except this time, it’s not just any clone. This figure claims to be **the real you**.

"You’re not the original," the clone says, a smirk on their face. "You’re just a copy. A reflection of what I once was, created during that accident. You’re the fake, sent to play out this twisted version of my life while I was trapped in the void. But now, I’m free."

Your heart sinks as the truth is revealed: during the freak accident in Chapter 1, you were separated from your true self. The clone you’ve been controlling this entire time is not the original, but a construct made by The Entity to carry out its plan. The real you was trapped in the void, watching as the clone—the version of you controlled by The Entity—fought through the corrupted world.

------------- PHASE 1: THE FIGHT WITH THE REAL YOU -------------

The battle begins, a confrontation against your true self. Every move they make feels eerily familiar, but they fight with a strength and clarity that you lack. As the real you attacks, they taunt you: "You’re nothing but a shadow, an illusion. I am the original, the real hero."

The fight is brutal, both physically and mentally, as you grapple with the truth of your existence. But through sheer willpower, you manage to defeat the real you, striking them down after an intense battle. As they fall, they smirk, whispering, "Even if you win this fight, you’re still not real. You’ll never be free."

Though victorious, the victory feels hollow, as you come to terms with the fact that you are not the original—just a copy created for The Entity’s dark purposes.

------------- PHASE 2: THE ENTITY’S WRATH -------------
 
With your clone defeated, The Entity itself emerges from the shadows, a monstrous force of pure corruption. The true final battle begins, but it quickly becomes apparent that no matter how hard you fight, you are outmatched. The Entity is not just an external force—it is part of you. Every time you land a blow, it feels like you are fighting against your own essence, and the weight of your existence bears down on you.

The Entity taunts you as you fight, saying, "You think defeating your original changes anything? You were made to serve me. Your life, your choices—they were never yours." 

Despite your best efforts, the battle is hopeless. The Entity's power is overwhelming, and slowly but surely, you are worn down, its dark energy seeping into you. No matter what you do, you cannot win. The truth that you were never meant to prevail sinks in, and you collapse in defeat, consumed by The Entity.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
                        ENDINGS
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

------------- The Forced Choice -------------
After your defeat, you are presented with two final choices:

= End it all
Overwhelmed by the revelation of your false existence, you can choose to end your life. This option leads to an immediate fade to black, bringing you back to the start menu as if your journey was nothing more than a fleeting dream. The game resets, and it’s as though your efforts never mattered.
  
= Atonement
Despite the hopelessness of your situation, you can choose to atone for your sins. A message appears, acknowledging the futility of your fight but praising your bravery for continuing to push forward. It tells you that while you may not be the real hero, your decision to keep going is an act of defiance against The Entity’s control. Upon restarting the game, small changes reflect your attempt to rebuild the world, but it remains shadowed by the weight of your failure.


------------- Secret Ending (unlocked by defeating The Entity) -------------

Though you are destined to lose the final battle, there is a secret ending that can be unlocked. If you somehow manage to defeat The Entity—an almost impossible feat requiring perfect strategy and a deep understanding of the game—you unlock the true ending.

In this alternate version of the battle, after you strike down The Entity, the corruption around you begins to fade. Instead of being consumed by darkness, you are bathed in light. The twisted world of Erotoma starts to restore itself, returning to its original beauty.

A mysterious figure appears before you, explaining the truth: "You were never meant to win. You were created by The Entity to perpetuate its cycle of destruction. But by breaking free and defeating it, you have shattered the chains that bind both yourself and this world."

The figure reveals that The Entity fed on the despair and chaos of the world, creating countless reflections of heroes to carry out its dark plans. By defeating it, you have broken the cycle, freeing both yourself and Erotoma from its corrupt influence.

The secret ending shows you standing over the restored world of Erotoma, not as a false reflection, but as a being who has broken free from The Entity’s control. The people begin to rebuild, and the land flourishes once more. Upon restarting the game, subtle changes show a world that is now free from The Entity’s grasp, with new characters and storylines reflecting the hope of a reborn Erotoma.







VERSION 2

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
       CHAPTER 1: THE TOWN WHERE EVERYTHING BEGAN
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

         In the mystical land of Erotoma, where magic and life delicately balance on the edge of oblivion, you stand at the Shrine of Beings. Before you lie the fates of several powerful characters, each tethered to a unique race vital to the world’s essence. The responsibility is yours alone: to choose the one who will lead the quest to save Erotoma from the looming shadows. With a breath, you make your choice. But the moment your decision is cast, chaos strikes.

         An unseen force shatters reality. A freak accident tears you from your companions, flinging you into an endless void. You drift in the cold emptiness, disoriented, until a Being—ancient, its form barely holding against time—appears before you. Its voice echoes with urgency as it warns of The Entity, a force of malevolence so great it threatens to consume all life. Yet before you can speak, ask questions, or even react, the Being disappears, and reality crumbles around you. You awaken in a twisted version of Erotoma, alone, the world unrecognizable and corrupted. Deep inside, a gnawing dread tells you that something, everything, is wrong.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
     CHAPTER 2: CLOSE BONDS CAN LEAVE DEEP WOUNDS
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

         As you wander through this grotesque landscape, the once-lush lands now tainted by The Entity’s dark touch, you come face-to-face with an unsettling sight: one of the companions you didn’t choose. But they are no longer the ally you remember. Corrupted and twisted by The Entity, their eyes burn with an unnatural fire as they lead their race into destruction.

         "You abandoned us," they spit, their voice laced with venom. Their words cut deep, and as their blade strikes with the force of betrayal, the battle is as much emotional as it is physical. Every blow they deliver carries the weight of their accusations. Yet, despite the pain, you push forward, defeating them in a fierce struggle. As they fall, their final words echo in the stillness: "You think you chose your path? You’re nothing more than a puppet." Doubt gnaws at you, leaving questions about the nature of your own decisions and the role you play in this chaotic world.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        CHAPTER 3: ONCE, I CALLED YOU MY FRIEND.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

         Determined but troubled, you press onward, deeper into the heart of the corrupted world. Another familiar face emerges—another character you left behind when you made your choice at the Shrine. They, too, are now a shadow of their former self, consumed by The Entity’s malevolence. Their once-noble cause has turned to madness, and they lead their people into chaos without remorse.

         "You’re part of this," they accuse, their eyes burning with the same dark fire. "You think you’re the hero, but you’ve been complicit all along. Your choices fed The Entity’s power!" Their accusations shake you to your core as the fight rages. It feels as though you're battling against your own guilt, and every strike they land only serves to deepen the self-doubt blooming inside you. Yet, despite the weight of their words, you defeat them. But their final, chilling declaration lingers in your mind long after the battle is over: "You don’t even know who you are."


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
     THE FINAL CHAPTER - PART 1: THE THEATRE OF CHAOS
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

         After a journey riddled with loss and unsettling truths, you arrive at the heart of the darkness. Here, in the deepest, most corrupted part of Erotoma, The Entity waits, a looming presence of pure malevolence. But before you can face it, a figure steps out from the shadows: your clone. This doppelgänger is no mere copy—it claims to be the real you.

         "You’re not the original," it snarls, its voice a cruel mirror of your own. "I was trapped in the void while you played out this twisted version of my life. You’re the fake, sent by The Entity to carry out its plan." The truth crashes over you like a tidal wave. In the chaotic accident that split you from your companions, you were also separated from your true self. The version of you that has been fighting through this broken world is nothing more than a puppet, a false reflection.

         The battle that follows is brutal. Your clone fights with a strength and clarity that you lack, and every blow feels like a confrontation with your own weakness. "You’re nothing but a shadow," it taunts, its voice heavy with scorn. "You’ll never be free." But even as despair threatens to swallow you whole, you push through, defeating the clone after a desperate struggle. As it falls, the real you whisper, "Even in victory, you’re not real." The truth leaves you hollow, as you finally accept that your existence is a cruel fabrication.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
THE FINAL CHAPTER - PART 2: YOUR DESTINY ISN'T YOURS TO CONTROL
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

         With your doppelgänger vanquished, The Entity emerges from the shadows. It is not a being of flesh but a monstrous force of corruption, its presence suffocating. The final battle begins, but it quickly becomes clear that no matter how hard you fight, you are outmatched. The Entity is not just a force external to you—it is woven into your very essence. Every strike you land only deepens the feeling that you are fighting yourself.

         "You think defeating your original changes anything?" The Entity’s voice is a cold whisper in your mind. "You were made for me. Your choices, your life—they were never yours to control." The weight of these revelations crushes you as the battle rages on. Despite your determination, The Entity’s power overwhelms you, its dark energy seeping into your soul. In the end, you are consumed, falling into the abyss as the world collapses around you.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
THE FINAL CHAPTER - EPILOGUE: HE ALWAYS LINGERS AT THE DOOR… WAITING…
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In the darkness, you are presented with two final choices:

- End it all
The truth of your existence weighs too heavily on your soul. You can choose to end it, embracing oblivion. The screen fades to black, and the world resets, as though your journey never mattered. Yet, within that darkness, a flicker of defiance stirs. You ponder the possibility of rising again, transforming your pain into purpose. Perhaps this cycle holds a chance to find meaning amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope that refuses to be extinguished.
  
- Stay alive
In the midst of despair, you are left powerless to intervene as the world descends into chaos. A message flickers before you, acknowledging your bravery for enduring this turmoil, even in the face of inevitable destruction. Being unable to alter the past, you witness the remnants of Erotoma burning, the scars of your failure etched into the landscape, a haunting reminder of what once was.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
THE FINAL CHAPTER - SECRET ENDING: BUT WHAT IF IT WAS TRULY YOURS
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

         But if you manage the impossible—defeating The Entity—you unlock the truth. As its monstrous form crumbles, the corruption fades, and light begins to return to Erotoma. A mysterious figure appears, revealing that you were never meant to win. You were a pawn in The Entity’s endless cycle of destruction, created to perpetuate its dark plans. But by breaking free and shattering The Entity, you have broken the chains that bound you—and the world.

         In this new world, Erotoma begins to heal. The land, once marred by darkness, flourishes once more. You stand transformed, no longer a mere shadow of your former self, but a being who has defied fate and liberated the world from an ancient curse. As the people come together to rebuild, a new era dawns, and the world is reborn—free from the grip of The Entity, offering fresh possibilities for those who remain.
