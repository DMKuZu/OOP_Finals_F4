- Keypoints version 1.0 (Sep 20)

Chapter 1 is the part where you choose your character and your chosen character is suddenly separated from the party due to some freak accident and encounters the last of The Beings

Chapter 2 ug 3 is fighting the unused characters and their corresponding race as they have become corrupted by the power of The Entity

Chapter 4 fighting The Entity, but created a clone of yourself, after beating both the clone and The Entity, you then find out that what you thought was The Entity was actually The Being of your character's race and the clone was actually the real you and you were actually just a mirror version made from that freak accident

After realizing that you were controlled by The Entity, you gather all your RELICS and gathered power of The Beings to turn back time and stop you and your friends from embarking on that quest, only to be controlled by The Entity once again, but instead of wreaking havoc once more, it chose to go back in time in order to release the seal that blocked any outsiders from seeing the island. Then it goes back to the start menu

- Keypoints version 1.1 (Oct 1)

#I think this sounds more coherent compared to the last version

Realizing that you were actually just a pawn of The Entity, you feel like everything you did was all worthless. You then gave yourself an ultimatum, whether to end your life or to Atone for your mistakes and move on forward to rebuild Erotoma, the world that you had destroyed.

Killing yourself will immediately show the start menu.
Atoning for your sins will show a message talking about the futility of your very actions but tells you that you are brave for pushing on forward despite your fatal mistakes.
